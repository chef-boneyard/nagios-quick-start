Description
===========

Installs and configures Nagios 3 for a server and NRPE for clients using Chef search capabilities.

Requirements
============

Chef
----

Chef version 0.10.10+ and Ohai 0.6.12+ are required.

Because of the heavy use of search, this recipe will not work with Chef Solo, as it cannot do any searches without a server.

A data bag named 'users' should exist, see __Data Bag__ below.

The system running the 'server' recipe should have a role named 'monitoring' so that NRPE clients can authorize monitoring from that system.  This role name is configurable via an attribute. See __Attributes__ below.

By default the Nagios server will only monitor systems in its same environment. To change this set the multi_environment_monitoring attribute. See __Attributes__ below.

Platform
--------

* Debian 6
* Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (CentOS/Amazon/Scientific/Oracle) 5.8, 6.3

**Notes**: This cookbook has been tested on the listed platforms. It
  may work on other platforms with or without modification.

Recipes
=======

default
-------

Includes the `nagios::client` recipe.

client
------

Includes the correct NRPE client installation recipe based on platform, either `nagios::client_package` or `nagios::client_source`.

The client recipe searches for servers allowed to connect via NRPE that have a role named in the `node['nagios']['server_role']` attribute. The recipe will also install the required packages and start the NRPE service. A custom plugin for checking memory is also added.

Searches are confined to the node's `chef_environment` unless multi-environment monitoring has been enabled via attribute.

Client commands for NRPE can be installed using the nrpecheck lwrp. (See __Resources/Providers__ below.)

client\_package
---------------

Installs the NRPE client and plugins from packages. Default for Debian / Ubuntu systems.

client\_source
--------------

Installs the NRPE client and plugins from source. Default for Redhat and Fedora based systems, as native packages for NRPE are not available in the default repositories.

server
------

Includes the correct client installation recipe based on platform, either `nagios::server_package` or `nagios::server_source`.

The server recipe sets up Apache as the web front end by default. The nagios::client recipe is also included. This recipe also does a number of searches to dynamically build the hostgroups to monitor, hosts that belong to them and admins to notify of events/alerts.

Searches are confined to the node's `chef_environment` unless multi-environment monitoring is enabled.

The recipe does the following:

1. Searches for members of the sysadmins group by searching through 'users' data bag and adds them to a list for notification/contacts.
2. Search all available roles and build a list which will be the Nagios hostgroups.
3. Search for all nodes of each role and add the hostnames to the hostgroups.
4. Installs various packages required for the server.
5. Sets up some configuration directories.
6. Moves the package-installed Nagios configuration to a 'dist' directory.
7. Disables the 000-default VirtualHost present on Debian/Ubuntu Apache2 package installations.
8. Enables the Nagios web front end configuration.
9. Sets up the configuration templates for services, contacts, hostgroups and hosts.


server\_package
---------------

Installs the Nagios server from packages. Default for Debian / Ubuntu systems.

server\_source
--------------

Installs the Nagios server from source. Default for Red Hat / Fedora based systems as native packages for Nagios 3 are not available in the default repositories.

pagerduty
---------

Installs and configures pagerduty plugin for nagios.  You need to set a `node['nagios']['pagerduty_key']` attribute on your server for this to work.  This can be set through environments so that you can use different API keys for servers in production vs staging for instance.

This recipe was written based on the [Nagios Integration Guide](http://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/nagios-integration-guide) from PagerDuty which explains how to get an API key for your nagios server.

email notifications
--------------------

You need to set `default['nagios']['notifications_enabled'] = 1` attribute on your nagios server to enable email notifications.

For email notifications to work an appropriate mail program package and local MTA need to be installed so that /usr/bin/mail or /bin/mail is available on the system.

Example:

Include [postfix cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/postfix) to be installed on your nagios server node.

Add override_attributes to your `monitoring` role:

    % cat roles/monitoring.rb

    name "monitoring"
    description "Monitoring Server"
    run_list(
      "recipe[nagios::server]",
      "recipe[postfix]"
    )

    override_attributes(
      "nagios" => { "notifications_enabled" => "1" },
      "postfix" => { "myhostname":"your_hostname", "mydomain":"example.com" }
    )

    default_attributes(
      "nagios" => { "server_auth_method" => "htauth" }
    )

    % knife role from file monitoring.rb

Data Bags
=========

Users
-----

Create a `users` data bag that will contain the users that will be able to log into the Nagios webui. Each user can use htauth with a specified password, or an openid. Users that should be able to log in should be in the sysadmin group. Example user data bag item:

    {
      "id": "nagiosadmin",
      "groups": "sysadmin",
      "htpasswd": "hashed_htpassword",
      "openid": "http://nagiosadmin.myopenid.com/",
      "nagios": {
        "pager": "nagiosadmin_pager@example.com",
        "email": "nagiosadmin@example.com"
      }
    }

When using server_auth_method 'openid', use the openid in the data bag item. Any other value for this attribute (e.g., "htauth", "htpasswd", etc) will use the htpasswd value as the password in `/etc/nagios3/htpasswd.users`.

The openid must have the http:// and trailing /. The htpasswd must be the hashed value. Get this value with htpasswd:

    % htpasswd -n -s nagiosadmin
    New password:
    Re-type new password:
    nagiosadmin:{SHA}oCagzV4lMZyS7jl2Z0WlmLxEkt4=

For example use the `{SHA}oCagzV4lMZyS7jl2Z0WlmLxEkt4=` value in the data bag.

Contacts and Contact Groups
---------------------------

For contacts that aren't people or to define contact templates, put items in the nagios_contacts and nagios_contactgroups data bags.

Services
--------

Create a nagios\_services data bag that will contain definitions for services to be monitored.  This allows you to add monitoring rules without mucking about in the services and commands templates.  Each service will be named based on the id of the data bag and the command will be named withe the same id prepended with "check\_".  Just make sure the id in your data bag doesn't conflict with a service or command already defined in the templates.

Here's an example of a service check for sshd that you could apply to all hostgroups:

    {
	  "id": "ssh",
      "hostgroup_name": "all",
	  "command_line": "$USER1$/check_ssh $HOSTADDRESS$"
    }

You may optionally define the service template for your service by including service_template and a valid template name.  Example:  "service_template": "special_service_template".  You may also optionally add a service description that will be displayed in the Nagios UI using "description": "My Service Name".  If this is not present the databag name will be used.  You can define escalations for this service by defining an escalation data bag and then adding 'use_escalation' with the escalation name.

Templates
---------

Templates are optional, but allow you to specify combinations of attributes to apply to a service.  Create a nagios_templates\ data bag that will contain definitions for templates to be used.  Each template need only specify id and whichever parameters you want to override.

Here's an example of a template that reduces the check frequency to once per day and changes the retry interval to 1 hour.

    {
      "id": "dailychecks",
      "check_interval": "86400",
      "retry": "3600"
    }

You then use the template in your service data bag as follows:

    {
      "id": "expensive_service_check",
      "hostgroup_name": "all",
      "command_line": "$USER1$/check_example $HOSTADDRESS$",
      "service_template": "dailychecks"
    }

Search Defined Hostgroups
-------------------------

Create a nagios\_hostgroups data bag that will contain definitions for Nagios hostgroups populated via search.  These data bags include a Chef node search query that will populate the Nagios hostgroup with nodes based on the search.

Here's an example to find all HP hardware systems for an "hp_systems" hostgroup:

	{
	  "search_query": "dmi_system_manufacturer:HP",
	  "hostgroup_name": "hp_systems",
	  "id": "hp_systems"
	}

Monitoring Systems Not In Chef
------------------------------

Create a nagios\_unmanagedhosts data bag that will contain definitions for hosts not in Chef that you would like to manage.  "hostgroups" can be an existing Chef role (every Chef role gets a Nagios hostgroup) or a new hostgroup.
Here's an example host definition:

	{
	  "address": "webserver1.mydmz.dmz",
	  "hostgroups": ["web_servers","production_servers"],
	  "id": "webserver1",
	  "notifications": 1
	}

Service Escalations
-------------------

You can optionally define service escalations for the data bag defined services.  Doing so involves two steps - creating the escalation data bag and invoking it from the service.  For example, to create an escalation to page managers on a 15 minute period after the 3rd page:

	{
      "name": "15-minute-escalation",
      "contact_groups": "managers",
      "first_notification": "3",
      "last_notification": "0",
      "escalation_period": "24x7",
      "notification_interval": "900"
	}

Then, in the service data bag,

	{
      "id": "my-service",
      ... 
      "use_escalation": "15-minute-escalation"
	}

Event Handlers
--------------

You can optionally define event handlers to trigger on service alerts by creating a nagios\_eventhandlers data bag that will contain definitions of event handlers for services monitored via Nagios.

This example event handler data bags restarts chef-client.  Note: This assumes you have already defined a NRPE job restart\_chef-client on the host where this command will run.  You can use the NRPE LWRP to add commands to your local NRPE configs from within your cookbooks.

	{
      "command_line": "$USER1$/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -t 45 -c restart_chef-client",
      "id": "restart_chef-client"
	}

Once you've defined an event handler you will need to add the event handler to a service definition in order to trigger the action.  See the example service definition below.

	{
      "command_line": "$USER1$/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -t 45 -c check_chef_client",
      "hostgroup_name": "linux",
      "id": "chef-client",
      "event_handler": "restart_chef-client"
	}


Monitoring Role
===============

Create a role to use for the monitoring server. The role name should match the value of the attribute "nagios[:server_role]". By default, this is 'monitoring'. For example:

    % cat roles/monitoring.rb
    name "monitoring"
    description "Monitoring server"
    run_list(
      "recipe[nagios::server]"
    )

    default_attributes(
      "nagios" => {
        "server_auth_method" => "htauth"
      }
    )

    % knife role from file monitoring.rb


Definitions
===========

nagios_conf
-----------

This definition is used to drop in a configuration file in the base Nagios configuration directory's conf.d. This can be used for customized configurations for various services.

Libraries
=========

default
-------

The library included with the cookbook provides some helper methods used in templates.

* nagios_boolean
* nagios_interval - calculates interval based on interval length and a given number of seconds.
* nagios_attr - retrieves a nagios attribute from the node.

Resources/Providers
===================

The nrpecheck LWRP provides an easy way to add and remove NRPE checks from within a cookbook.

# Actions

- :add: creates a NRPE configuration file and restart the NRPE process. Default action.
- :remove: removes the configuration file and restart the NRPE process

# Attribute Parameters

- command_name: name attribute.  The name of the check.  You'll need to reference this in your commands.cfg template
- warning_condition: String that you will pass to the command with the -w flag
- critical_condition: String that you will pass to the command with the -c flag
- command: The actual command to execute (including the path). If this is not specified, this will use `node['nagios']['plugin_dir']/command_name` as the path to the command.
- parameters: Any additional parameters you wish to pass to the plugin.

# Examples

    # Use LWRP to define check_load
    nagios_nrpecheck "check_load" do
      command "#{node['nagios']['plugin_dir']}/check_load"
      warning_condition node['nagios']['checks']['load']['warning']
      critical_condition node['nagios']['checks']['load']['critical']
      action :add
    end

    # Remove the check_load definition
    nagios_nrpecheck "check_load" do
      action :remove
    end

Usage
=====

For a Nagios server, create a role named 'monitoring', and add the following recipe to the run_list:

    recipe[nagios::server]

This will allow client nodes to search for the server by this role and add its IP address to the allowed list for NRPE.

To install Nagios and NRPE on a client node:

    include_recipe "nagios::client"

This is a fairly complicated cookbook. For a walkthrough and example usage please see [Opscode's Nagios Quick Start](http://help.opscode.com/kb/otherhelp/nagios-quick-start).
